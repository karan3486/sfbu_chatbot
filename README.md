## Overview
This project is a web-based chatbot powered by AI to assist users with inquiries and tasks. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand user input and respond intelligently. It integrates data from multiple sources such as PDFs, web URLs, and YouTube transcripts, making it an intelligent and contextually aware assistant.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Recognizes and processes user input in natural language.
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation flow by remembering previous interactions.
- **Data Integration**: Retrieves information from PDFs, web URLs, and YouTube transcripts.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays a loading spinner when processing user queries.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **NLP Model**: OpenAI's GPT model or similar for language understanding
- **Data Handling**: FAISS for vector-based similarity search, YouTube API, PDF parsing

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
   cd chatbot-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

3. Type a message into the input field, and the chatbot will respond based on available data.

## Configuration
- **API Keys**: Place your OpenAI API key and any other necessary API keys in the `.env` file.
- **Data Sources**: Place any PDFs in the `data/` folder. You can also specify URLs in `urls.txt` to allow the chatbot to fetch additional content.

## API Endpoints
- **POST `/ask`**: Handles user queries and returns the chatbot's response.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "question": "Your question here"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "Chatbot's response"
    }
    ```

## Future Improvements
- **Voice Interaction**: Add speech-to-text capabilities for a voice-based chatbot.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate with more databases and APIs.
- **Custom NLP Model**: Fine-tune an NLP model specific to this chatbot's domain.
